I have not applied to Together yet and I am going to fix it afterwards. Apply the code below and I can easily edit the toggle through the github.

How to Apply
(Together -> notice board -> Setting -> Copy and paste the code below) ~ [ PC Web and mobile versions are available separately. ]

PC Apply Code
@import url("https://maejaengtgd.github.io/CSS/maejaeng.css");

Mobile Apply Code
@import url("https://maejaengtgd.github.io/CSS/m_maejaeng.css");

Ahh ... please help me please.
