I have not applied to Togther yet and I am going to fix it afterwards.
Apply the code below and I can easily edit the toggle through the github.

# How to Apply #

(Togther -> notice board -> Setting -> Copy and paste the code below) ~ [ 
PC Web and mobile versions are available separately. ]

# PC Apply Code #

@import url("https://maejaengtgd.github.io/CSS/maejaeng.css");

# Mobile Apply Code #

@import url("https://maejaengtgd.github.io/CSS/m_maejaeng.css");
